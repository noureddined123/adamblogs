# Understand the relationship between Food and sport

In sports, the diet of a sportsperson is significant as it affects the overall performance of the sportsperson. A healthy diet will help the sportsperson - boost energy and have good muscle strength. If you have a question about a healthy diet, then we would say there is no perfect definition of a healthy diet for a sportsperson because a diet plan varies according to what kind of game you play; for example, a daily diet of a weightlifter will be different from the diet plan of the athlete. The relationship between your Food and sport requires you to understand and maintain your training needs and general health.

So if you are in sports, the key to performing consistently is to keep your body fit enough to go through all the training sessions. So, giving you a clear idea of what you eat and how it affects your body can help you perform better in the sports you play. 

## Nutrition and a healthy body

It is a stated fact that a portion of good nutritious food is essential for a healthy body and health. Let's see a daily intake of nutrients in Food help you in activities related to your game.

## Daily intake of Nutrients

You have to make sure that you have the proper balance of nutrients in your Food, so when you play and train, you won't get tired easily. 

Your Food should have calories, carbohydrates, protein, fluids, iron, and other needed minerals.

So, include a wide variety of foods like wholegrain bread, vegetables (particularly leafy green varieties), fruit, lean meat, and low-fat dairy products that will provide you energy and increase your stamina. 

## Carbohydrates and exercise

Carbs provide you energy during your exercise. Many people do not estimate the number of calories they need to burn out during a workout and end up with more energy they need. So, knowing your carbs intake after intense exercise or before exercise according to the time you are going to exercise is vital for attaining a fit body.



## Before exercise 

Before exercising for more than 1 hour, your carbs intake should have fruit juice or some fresh fruits.

If you are going to do more than an hour of intense workout, you can drink a sports drink with 15 minutes of interval or granola bars.



## After Exercise

It would help if you took carbohydrates after your exercise to rebuild the energy you lost during your workout session. If you exercise or train for more than 90 minutes, you should eat more carbs after two hours; it would be better to include protein. And if you train in less than an hour, keep your body hydrated.

## Protein 

Protein intake is essential to recover energy after intense workout sessions. The protein amount recommended for sporting people like you is slightly higher than the protein amount recommended for non-sporty people. 

If you exercise daily between 45-60 minutes, your daily intake of protein should be around 1 to 1.2g/ kg of your body weight.

If you train for more than an hour, you should consume 1.2-1.7g/kg of your body weight.

This is all about the Food and your nutrition intake for improving your sports performance. So, keep in mind and always stay conscious about the food you take. So, you can balance your diet even on your cheat day or after that.
