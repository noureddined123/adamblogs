# Actionable tips for incorporating fitness in everyday life 



Focusing on health and well-being and motivating others to do so is the new cool thing in modern society. And people are rightly doing it because 40% of fatal chronic diseases can be prevented through a healthy lifestyle. It involves focusing on a holistic approach to attaining fitness in physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual areas. The basic steps to this approach include eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly. Doctors even argue that people who find it difficult to exercise in one go can adopt a new method. Exercising for 15-20 minutes in the mornings and evenings will do the trick. 

However, if someone feels overwhelmed, here are a few actionable tips to try out today. 



## Personalized workout goals 

According to experts, people are more likely to stick to their exercise routine if tailored to their needs. To do so, they first need to understand the objectives of their workout schedules. They need to ask themselves several questions to figure this out. Some examples are:

● "Do I want to build muscle?"

● "Do I need to lose weight?"  

● "Do I need to work on specific areas of my body? 

The questions will clarify the goals and help them exercise as per their requirements. 

## Specific fitness goals 

Vague statements like losing weight, looking slim, looking healthy can't be accounted for as goals. It is because these are not measurable. How is a person supposed to know how slim they need to look? So, they should focus on setting SMART fitness goals. A SMART goal is an acronym for specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound goals. One can also consult a professional trainer to establish these goals and design workout routines. 

## Holding accountable 

Planning is of no use if one fails to execute it. So, there has to be some factor to hold themselves accountable. Many people invest in expensive gym memberships and other resources to hold themselves accountable. Some other people prefer booking workout slots with their friends and motivating each other to stick to the plan. So, trying these methods out enables people to stay on track. 

## Tracking the progress 

It is important for several reasons. First of all, it is a motivating experience to look at how far one has come. Secondly, it helps to alter the routine as per the progress made. Numerous apps allow users to track their fitness goals and document the process. One can also do this in Google sheets or a physical calendar. Some people also like to keep a workout journal for recording their progress and writing their thoughts about it at the same time. 

## Knowing the obstacles beforehand 

It is good to identify the possible obstacles before jumping into the workout routine. It is wise to sit back and think if it is easy to follow or not. If not, identifying and eliminating the shortcomings enables one to sharpen the plan for success. So, taking some time for this process is also vital. 



## Sum Up

Doctors and experts emphasize how exercise is key to the overall well-being of a person. However, one should first determine their needs to find the fitness pathway. It will help them to make sure that they don't slip midway. After all, health is common for all stages in life!
